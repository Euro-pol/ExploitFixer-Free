# ExploitFixer

ExploitFixer is a high performance packet filter that prevents many kinds of crashers, laggers and exploits from being used in your Spigot/Paper server.

You can download the prebuilt jar binaries in the link below.

## How to build  
Since the author decided to remove the pom.xml, here it is. They also nuked their maven repo so you will have to download HamsterAPI manually.  
1. Download [HamsterAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/2ls-hamsterapi.78831/)
2. Put it in a folder
3. Change the path in the pom.xml to it (line 45)  
4. Run `mvn clean install`
